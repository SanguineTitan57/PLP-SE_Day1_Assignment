Software Engineering Module Day 1 Assignment

Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    - Software Engineering refers to the development of software under a systematic set of guidelines and principles. It involves the writing of code, which instruct computers on what to do.

    - Importance of Software Engineering:
        - Ensures the creation of high-quality software products that meet user requirements.
        - Solving of real-world problems through the development of software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    - The origin and development of the first high-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL.

    - The software crisis of the 1960s, which led to the development of structured programming and software engineering methodologies and documentation. 
        -Computers had become to complex and powerful for programmers at the time to effectively use those capabilities. This ledd to software projects going over the budget, being delivered late, and not meeting the requirements.

    - The prominence of the internet.
        Due to the rapid growth in demand for international communication and display systems, the Hypertext Markup Language and E-mails were born. Also, due to the significant interconnection between computers via emails, antiviruses and semi-automated scanning of emails were developed to prevent spread of computer viruses.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1. Design
        - Systems have to be designed in a way where they can be easily maintained, updated and be cost-effective. It involves creating a blueprint or a set of guidelines to guide the engineers.
    2. Development
        - Writing of code, which forms the basis of the system and it's functions.
    3. Testing
        - Testing for any logical and syntax errors in the code. This includes also checking for any unexpected responses to unexpected or wrong inputs.
    4. Deployment
        - Availing the code to the end-users.
    5. Maintenance
        - Regular updates and bug fixes to the code.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall
        - A linear and sequential approach to software development that consists of several phases, whereby, one phase must be completed before the next is begun. Examples are in development of an online banking system, where each phase must be completed before the next is begun, to ensure that the code is bug-free and no errors are made in transactions.

    Agile
        - A flexible and iterative approach to software development that focuses on delivering working software in small increments. Examples are in the development of a mobile application, where the developers can release a beta version of the app to the public, and then make updates based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    - Software Developer
        - Writes code, tests code, and maintains code.
    - Quality Assurance Engineer
        - Tests the code for bugs and errors, and ensures that the code meets the requirements.
    - Project Manager
        - Manages the project, ensures that the project is completed on time and within budget, and communicates with stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    - IDEs are specialized applications that enable programmers to safely develop and test code without unintended interference with other applications on the device. Examples include: XCode, VS Code, Sublime Text 3.

    - VCS are systems that allow developers to track changes in the codebase, collaborate with other developers, and revert to previous versions of the code. Examples include: Git, SVN, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    - Lack of clear goals- if the goals or objectives keep changing, it may be difficult for the developers to keep up. To overcome this, the developers should have a clear outline of the project requirements and objectives.

    - Poor communication- if the developers are not able to communicate effectively, it may lead to misunderstandings and errors in the code. To overcome this, the developers should have regular meetings to discuss the project and any issues that may arise.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    - Unit testing- testing individual components of the code to ensure that they work as expected.
    - Integration testing- testing how different components of the code work together.
    - System testing- testing the entire system to ensure that it meets the requirements.
    - Acceptance testing- testing the system with the end-users to ensure that it meets their needs.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    - Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing prompts that are clear, specific, and concise to interact with AI models. It is important in ensuring that the AI model understands the user's intent and provides accurate responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    - Vague prompt: "What is the weather like today?"
    - Improved prompt: "What is the weather forecast for New York City today?"
    - The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the location (New York City) and the type of information required (weather forecast), making it clear, specific, and concise.
